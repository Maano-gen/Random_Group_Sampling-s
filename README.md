# Random Group Sampling

This Python script generates random groups from predefined lists of entries. It divides the entries into a specified number of groups using a random distribution method. Additionally, it calculates statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of the counts for each group.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `random_group_sampling.py` script to generate random groups.
3. View the generated groups in the `groups.txt` file and the statistics in the console output.
4. Optionally, view the HTML report in the `final.html` file for a detailed analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy library

## How it Works

The script defines three groups labeled A, B, and C, each containing a certain number of units/plants. It then combines all units/plants into a single list, shuffles them randomly, and divides them into the specified number of groups using a random distribution method. Statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of the counts for each group are calculated and printed in the console output.
